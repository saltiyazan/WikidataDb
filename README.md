This is a wiki-data game implemented in JAVA.
All movies with no genre defined in the wiki-data database are queried by this program, with all the genres.
Then the user is asked to assign a genre to each movie.
this project is (server) responsible for the data retrieval, database management and defining an endpoint for the client program.
Client program project repository can be found on the following URL:

In the future, this project should fulfill the requirements of the Wikidata distributed game so it can be reachable online with all the other games.
